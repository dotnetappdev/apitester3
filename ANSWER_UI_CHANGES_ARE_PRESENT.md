## The Confusion Explained

Your question: *"why am i not seeing ur last lot of changes in my bracnh"*

**Answer:** The changes ARE in your branch (commit `8da64dc` on main). They were merged in PR #56.

**Why you might not be seeing them:**
1. ❌ You're on a different branch (not main)
2. ❌ You haven't pulled the latest from main
3. ❌ You haven't logged into the application
4. ❌ Your browser cache is showing an old version
5. ❌ You're looking at documentation that describes features but the app isn't running

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "Still don't see changes!"

**Issue:** Wrong branch or not updated
```bash
git branch  # Check current branch
git log -1 --oneline  # Check commit
# Should show commit 8da64dc or newer
```

**Fix:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

### "Login screen looks the same"

**That's normal!** The login screen didn't change. 

The UI improvements are in the **MAIN INTERFACE** after you log in.

**Fix:** Login with `admin` / `password`

---

### "Browser shows old version"

**Issue:** Cached assets

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or use incognito/private browsing mode

---

### "Can't create a profile"

**You don't need to!** Use the existing profiles.

The app comes with 5 pre-configured accounts. Just select one from the login screen or manually enter:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`
