### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
# Development mode (recommended for testing UI)
npm run dev

# Or build for production

```

### Step 4: Log In to See the UI

The application requires authentication. After running `npm run dev`:

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the changes"

**Possible causes:**

1. **Wrong branch:**
   ```bash
   # Check your branch
   git branch
   
   # Switch to main if needed
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Outdated local copy:**
   ```bash
   # Fetch all changes
   git fetch --all
   
   # Reset to remote main (WARNING: loses local changes)
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

3. **Browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito/private mode

4. **Not logged in:**
   - The main UI only appears after authentication
   - Create a profile and log in first

### "The dev server won't start"

```bash
# Remove old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### "I see errors in the console"

Some database errors are expected on first run. The application creates a local SQLite database automatically.

## What Branch Should I Be On?

- **Main branch** (`main`) - Contains all completed and merged UI improvements
- **Your feature branch** - Should be created FROM main to get all changes

### To create a new feature branch with all changes:

```bash
# Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch from main
git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name

# Now you have all the UI improvements
```
