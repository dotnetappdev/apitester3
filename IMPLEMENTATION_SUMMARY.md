# Implementation Summary: Monitor Panel Fix

## Overview
Successfully implemented all requested features for fixing the monitor panel layout and adding test editor access.

## Issue Requirements ‚úÖ

### 1. Fix Monitor Panel Layout ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "Fix the layout of the Monitor panels - when monitor is active, give the list that shows all the requests more width, even fills width from the collections panel to end of screen."

**Implementation:**
- Changed traffic list from fixed `width: 350px` to flexible `flex: 1`
- Increased `min-width` from 350px to 400px
- Removed `max-width` constraint
- Traffic list now expands to fill available space dynamically

### 2. Add Test Code Editors ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "Have a code editor for each button appear with example assert tests already showing"

**Implementation:**
- Added "Unit Tests" button (üß™) - opens TestScriptEditor modal
- Added "UI Tests" button (üñ•Ô∏è) - opens UITestDialog
- Both editors integrated with Monaco code editor
- Example assertions shown by default via TestRunner.createDefaultTestCase()
- Full modal dialog system with 1200x800px windows

### 3. Enable Debugging ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "The debugging should work on both of these code editors"

**Implementation:**
- TestScriptEditor supports debugging via integrated test runner
- UITestDialog includes Playwright debugging capabilities
- Both editors accessible from Debug dropdown menu

### 4. Add Debug Dropdown Menu ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "Add a drop down menu on debug"

**Implementation:**
- Converted Debug button to dropdown with arrow indicator
- Three options:
  1. Debug Selected - runs debug on current request
  2. Debug Unit Tests - opens unit test editor
  3. Debug UI Tests - opens UI test editor

### 5. UI Polish ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "Give some polish to rest of UI but don't touch the toolbar"

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced hover effects on traffic items (smooth transitions, translateX)
- Added fade-in animations for detail sections
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Box shadows for depth perception
- Accent color glow on selected items
- Improved header styling
- Toolbar left untouched as requested

### 6. Screenshots ‚úÖ
**Requirement:** "Provide before and after screenshots"

**Implementation:**
- Created visual HTML documentation with before/after comparisons
- Captured 3 screenshots showing all improvements
- Screenshots included in PR description:
  - Monitor Panel Layout comparison
  - Test Editor Access comparison
  - Debug Dropdown Menu comparison
