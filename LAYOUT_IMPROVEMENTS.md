# Window Layout Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the application window layout and tab styling to make them more professional and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Professional Tab Styling
**Files Modified:** 
- `src/styles/index.css`
- `src/components/EnhancedRequestPanel.tsx`
- `src/components/ResponsePanel.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added icons to all tabs (🔍 Params, 📋 Headers, 📝 Body, 🔐 Auth, 🧪 Tests, 📄 Response Body)
- ✅ Increased padding from 12px to 14px for better touch targets
- ✅ Improved font weight (600 → 700 for active tabs)
- ✅ Enhanced border thickness (2px → 3px) for better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Added border-radius to tabs (6px 6px 0 0) for modern look
- ✅ Improved tab badges with better styling and hover effects
- ✅ Added letter-spacing (0.3px) for better readability
- ✅ Capitalized tab labels for consistency
- ✅ Enhanced hover effects with underline preview
- ✅ Improved spacing between tabs (margin: 0 2px)

### 2. Vertical Layout for Request/Response
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DockableLayout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed layout orientation from horizontal (side-by-side) to vertical (stacked)
- ✅ Response panel now appears below the Request panel instead of beside it
- ✅ Adjusted default split ratio to 60/40 (request/response)
- ✅ Request section now takes full width after the navigation sidebar
- ✅ Improved minimum sizes for better usability

**Benefits:**
- More horizontal space for editing request URLs and parameters
- Better use of screen real estate on widescreen monitors
- Easier to read longer response bodies
- More consistent with industry-standard API testing tools

### 3. Full Width Request Editor
**Result:**
- Request editor now spans the full width of the main content area
- Only constrained by the left navigation sidebar
- Better visibility of long URLs and parameters
- Improved usability on large monitors

## Visual Changes

### Before
- Tabs had minimal styling with small padding
- No icons for visual identification
- Horizontal split layout (Request | Response)
- Limited horizontal space for request editing

### After
- Professional tabs with icons and improved spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy with enhanced active states
- Vertical split layout (Request above Response)
- Full-width request editor for better productivity
- Better badge styling with hover effects
- Modern rounded tabs with smooth transitions

## Technical Details

### CSS Classes Modified
1. `.request-tabs` - Added padding, improved border
2. `.request-tab` - Enhanced padding, weight, borders, and transitions
3. `.tab` - Improved styling for response panel tabs
4. `.tab-badge` - Enhanced badge appearance with hover states
5. Added `.tab-icon` styling for emoji icons

### Component Updates
1. **EnhancedRequestPanel.tsx**
   - Added tab icons mapping
   - Wrapped tab labels in span elements
   - Added icon span before each tab label

2. **ResponsePanel.tsx**

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on different screen sizes (1920x1080, 2560x1440, 4K)
2. Verify tab interactions (hover, click, active states)
3. Test vertical split resizing
4. Verify response panel visibility with different content sizes
5. Test on mobile/tablet devices (already has responsive layout)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
