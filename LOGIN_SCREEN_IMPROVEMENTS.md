# Login Screen Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the login screen to address the issue with the cluttered form layout and missing delete account functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Delete Account Functionality

#### Backend Changes
- **DatabaseManager.ts**: Added `deleteUser(userId: number)` method that properly deletes a user and all their related data in a transaction
- **AuthManager.ts**: Added `deleteAccount(username: string, password: string)` method that verifies the user's password before deletion
- **sqliteManager.ts**: Implemented the database layer for user deletion with proper cascading deletes:
  - Deletes all user's requests
  - Deletes all user's collections
  - Deletes team memberships
  - Deletes teams owned by the user
  - Deletes the user account
- **main.ts**: Added IPC handler for `db-delete-user`
- **preload.ts**: Added type definitions and IPC invocation for `dbDeleteUser`

#### Frontend Changes
- **LoginDialog.tsx**: 
  - Added "Delete Account" state management
  - Created delete account dialog with password confirmation
  - Added warning message about permanent deletion
  - Added "Delete Account" card to the profiles grid
  - Implemented `handleDeleteAccount` function with proper validation

### 2. Improved CSS Styling

#### Form Styling
- Added `.form-group` class with proper spacing
- Added label styling for better readability
- Improved input focus states with accent color and subtle shadow
- Fixed margin issues with profile inputs

#### Action Card Styling
- Added consistent styling for "Reset Password" and "Delete Account" cards
- Added proper icon sizing for action cards
- Added hover effects for better user feedback
- Added text styling for action card labels

### 3. Login Screen Layout

The login screen now has a clean, organized layout:

1. **Profile Selection Grid**: Shows all user profiles with avatar, username, role badge, and last login
2. **Action Cards Row**: 
   - Add Profile (for admins only)
   - Reset Password
   - Delete Account
3. **Login Form**: Appears below the grid when a profile is selected
   - Shows selected profile
   - Password input field
   - Continue button

## Security Features

### Delete Account Security
- Requires username AND password verification before deletion
- Shows clear warning about permanent deletion
- Uses database transactions to ensure data integrity
- Automatically logs out the user if they delete their own account

### Password Reset Security
- Minimum password length of 6 characters
- Password confirmation required
- Proper error messages for validation failures

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner Layout**: Removed inline buttons from profile cards, keeping them focused on selection
2. **Organized Actions**: All account management actions (add, reset password, delete) are in dedicated cards
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Hover states on all interactive elements
   - Focus states with accent color
   - Loading states on buttons
   - Error messages with clear styling
4. **Confirmation Flow**: Delete account requires explicit password confirmation
5. **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapts to available space

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying, test the following scenarios:

1. **Delete Account Flow**:
   - Verify password is required
   - Test with incorrect password
   - Verify user and all data are deleted
   - Confirm user is logged out after deleting own account
   
2. **Reset Password Flow**:
   - Test password validation (min 6 characters)
   - Test password mismatch error
   - Verify user can login with new password

3. **Profile Selection**:
   - Click different profiles to select them
   - Verify selected profile is highlighted
   - Verify login form shows correct profile

4. **Visual Testing**:
   - Check hover states on all cards
   - Verify focus states on inputs
   - Test error message display
   - Verify responsive layout at different window sizes

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/LoginDialog.tsx` - Added delete account UI and logic
2. `src/auth/AuthManager.ts` - Added deleteAccount method
3. `src/database/DatabaseManager.ts` - Added deleteUser method
4. `src/styles/index.css` - Improved styling for forms and action cards
5. `electron/sqliteManager.ts` - Implemented database deletion logic
6. `electron/main.ts` - Added IPC handler
7. `electron/preload.ts` - Added type definitions

## Notes

- The delete account feature uses database transactions to ensure all related data is properly cleaned up
- Admin users can create new profiles, but any user can delete their own account
- The layout is designed to be extensible for future action cards if needed
