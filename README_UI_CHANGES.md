Run these commands to confirm all UI changes exist:

```bash
# Check for new component files
ls -lh src/components/AboutDialog.tsx
ls -lh src/components/ReportProblemDialog.tsx
ls -lh src/constants/appInfo.ts

# Check for Help menu
grep "showHelpMenu" src/components/DockableLayout.tsx

## 🎯 Why You Might Not See Them

### Reason 1: Wrong Branch ❌
You may be on an old branch that doesn't have the latest changes.

**Solution:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Reason 2: Not Logged In ❌
The new UI features appear **after login**, not on the login screen.

**Solution:**
- Login with username: `admin`, password: `password`
- Or any of these: `testuser`, `developer`, `qa_lead`, `api_tester` (all use password: `password`)

### Reason 3: App Not Rebuilt ❌
You updated the code but didn't rebuild the application.

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Reason 4: Browser Cache ❌
Your browser is showing a cached old version.

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or use incognito/private mode

### Reason 5: Feature Branch Not Updated ❌
Your feature branch doesn't have the latest main branch changes.

**Solution:**
```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🖼️ Login Screen Reference

When you run the app, you'll first see this:

![Login Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee2c8d95-e0b9-4b1a-86bf-cb69f73e213f)

**This is normal!** The login screen didn't change.

The UI improvements are in the **main interface AFTER you log in**.

**Login credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`
