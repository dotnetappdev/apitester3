## 🖼️ Visual Reference

### Login Screen
![Login Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee2c8d95-e0b9-4b1a-86bf-cb69f73e213f)

**Note:** The login screen didn't change. The UI improvements are in the **main interface AFTER you log in**.

---

## 🎯 Why You Might Not See Them

### Common Reasons:

1. ❌ **Wrong Branch** - You're not on `main`
   - Fix: `git checkout main && git pull`

2. ❌ **Not Logged In** - Changes only appear after authentication
   - Fix: Login with `admin` / `password`

3. ❌ **Not Rebuilt** - Code updated but app not rebuilt
   - Fix: `npm install && npm run dev`

4. ❌ **Browser Cache** - Showing old cached version
   - Fix: Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

5. ❌ **Feature Branch Outdated** - Your branch doesn't have main's changes
   - Fix: `git merge main`
